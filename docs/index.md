## Overview
Welcome to mr-seek's documentation! This guide is the main source of documentation for users that are getting started with the [Mendelian randomization pipeline](https://github.com/OpenOmics/mr-seek/). 

The **`./mr-seek`** pipeline is composed several inter-related sub commands to setup and run the pipeline across different systems. Each of the available sub commands perform different functions: 

 * [<code>mr-seek <b>run</b></code>](usage/run.md): Run the mr-seek pipeline with your input files.
 * [<code>mr-seek <b>unlock</b></code>](usage/unlock.md): Unlocks a previous runs output directory.
 * [<code>mr-seek <b>cache</b></code>](usage/cache.md): Cache remote resources locally, coming soon!

**mr-seek** is a comprehensive mendelian randomization pipeline. It relies on technologies like [Singularity<sup>1</sup>](https://singularity.lbl.gov/) to maintain the highest-level of reproducibility. The pipeline consists of a series of data processing and quality-control steps orchestrated by [Snakemake<sup>2</sup>](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), a flexible and scalable workflow management system, to submit jobs to a cluster.

The pipeline is compatible with data generated from Illumina short-read sequencing technologies. As input, it accepts a set of QTL files and outcome phenotypes and can be run locally on a compute instance or on-premise using a cluster. A user can define the method or mode of execution. The pipeline can submit jobs to a cluster using a job scheduler like SLURM (more coming soon!). A hybrid approach ensures the pipeline is accessible to all users.

Before getting started, we highly recommend reading through the [usage](usage/run.md) section of each available sub command.
